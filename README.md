# Analyzing-Fitness-Tracker-Data
With the explosion in fitness tracker popularity, runners all of the world are collecting data with gadgets (smartphones, watches, etc.) to keep themselves motivated.we all look for answers to questions like:

How fast, long, and intense was my run today?

Have I succeeded with my training goals?

Am I progressing?

What were my best achievements?

How do I perform compared to others?


I have used data downloaded from Runkeeper app. The data is a CSV file where each row is a single training activity. In this project, I will import, clean, and analyze the data to answer all the above questions.
